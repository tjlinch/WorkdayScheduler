# Workday Scheduler

## Description

This application is supposed to use moment.js to display the current day and time to a user, and allow them to schedule events for each hour of their work day.
I was able to display the current day in the header,and create the timeblocks by way of form elements.
I have struggled for hours on both capturing the basic user inputs, and getting the moment() into a format that can be compared to the value of the hour label element.
