</header>

refer to css for class names throughout?

js

want to display current day in the header <p> element with an id of "currentDay" using moment()

timeblocks already made in html

capture user text inputs and save them in local storage

retrieve the saved values in local storage, and update the text inputs with values

if the current hour is later than any given timeblock, that timeblock needs to be assigned the class of 'past'

if the current hour is equal to a timeblock, assign class of 'present'

if the current hour is earlier than a timeblock, assign class of 'future'
